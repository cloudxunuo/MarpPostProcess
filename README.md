# Installation
- Install the VS Code extension `Marp for VS Code`.
- Execute `./scripts/install.bat`.


# Writing your markdown
- It's better to create a folder in `./src`, with one markdown file per folder.


# Publishing your markdown
- You can choose one of two ways:
    - Publish using the exporting command in `Marp for VS Code`.
    - Publish using the OS Marp `build.js`, which will generate an HTML slide deck file.
        - At the root directory, execute node `.\scripts\build.js .\src\path_to_your_file.md`.
        - The output file will be `.\src\path_to_your_file.html.`
